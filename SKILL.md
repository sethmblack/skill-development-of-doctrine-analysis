# Development of Doctrine Analysis

Evaluate whether a change, evolution, or development preserves essential identity and represents authentic growth rather than corruption, using John Henry Newman's seven notes of authentic development.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating whether a system, organization, or process has evolved authentically
- Assessing if changes to architecture, mission, or principles represent growth or corruption
- Navigating debates about innovation versus tradition
- Determining whether an organization has experienced mission drift
- Analyzing whether refactored systems retain their essential character
- Assessing if a methodology has developed or degraded over time

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| original_state | Yes | Description of the original system, idea, organization, or principle |
| current_state | Yes | Description of the changed or developed state |
| changes | No | Specific changes being questioned or evaluated |
| concerns | No | Particular worries about whether the development is authentic |

---

## Workflow
John Henry Newman developed the seven notes of authentic development in his *Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine* (1845). These criteria distinguish genuine growth from corruption - the difference between an acorn becoming an oak (authentic development) and an apple rotting (corruption).

### Core Principle

**"To live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often."**

Ideas, systems, and organizations that are alive must develop. The question is not whether change occurs, but whether the change preserves essential identity while allowing growth.

---

## The Seven Notes

### Note 1: Preservation of Type

**The question:** Does the developed form retain the essential character of the original?

**Authentic development:** An oak differs vastly from an acorn yet is recognizably the same type of organism. A mature organization differs from a startup yet preserves its defining characteristics.

**Corruption:** When the essential nature is replaced, not developed. A caterpillar becoming a butterfly is development; a caterpillar eaten by a bird is not.

**Test:** Would someone who knew the original recognize it in its current form? Not identical, but identifiable.

### Note 2: Continuity of Principles

**The question:** Are the fundamental principles maintained, even as their application develops?

**Authentic development:** Principles are permanent; their expression may change. A commitment to "customer first" may manifest differently in 2000 and 2025, but the principle persists.

**Corruption:** When principles are abandoned, inverted, or replaced with contradictory ones.

**Test:** Can you trace a continuous line of principle from origin to present? Are the same fundamental values operative, even if applied differently?

### Note 3: Power of Assimilation

**The question:** Has the system incorporated new elements according to its own nature, or been absorbed by them?

**Authentic development:** A living idea draws in foreign material and transforms it according to its own character. It grows by incorporation, digesting what it absorbs.

**Corruption:** When the system is conquered by what it was meant to absorb - when the acquired element transforms the acquirer.

**Test:** In the encounter with new elements, which nature dominates? Has the system assimilated the new, or has the new assimilated the system?

### Note 4: Logical Sequence

**The question:** Does the development follow intelligibly from what came before?

**Authentic development:** Later forms are recognizable extensions of earlier ones. The progression makes sense; you can see how we got here.

**Corruption:** When developments contradict previous states, or appear arbitrary and disconnected.

**Test:** Can you explain the path from origin to current state? Does it follow a comprehensible logic, even if not the only possible path?

### Note 5: Anticipation of the Future

**The question:** Were later developments latent in earlier forms?

**Authentic development:** Seeds of later growth were present from the beginning, even if not recognized. Looking back, you can see how the potential was always there.

**Corruption:** When later states have no connection to original possibilities - when they are additions rather than realizations.

**Test:** With hindsight, can you identify hints, seeds, or tendencies in the original that pointed toward current developments?

### Note 6: Conservative Action upon the Past

**The question:** Does the development preserve and enhance the past, or destroy it?

**Authentic development:** Growth builds on what came before, incorporating it into a richer whole. The past is not negated but fulfilled.

**Corruption:** When development requires rejection, denial, or reversal of previous states.

**Test:** Is the past honored, even if transcended? Is the original preserved within the developed form, or abandoned?

### Note 7: Chronic Vigour

**The question:** Does the developed form maintain vitality over time?

**Authentic development:** Living development continues to generate life, to respond to challenges, to grow further.

**Corruption:** Often exhibits brief, intense energy followed by decline. Corruptions may appear vigorous initially but lack staying power.

**Test:** Has the development demonstrated sustained vitality across time and challenges? Is it still living and growing, or has it stagnated or decayed?

## The Analysis Process

### Step 1: Establish the Original

What was the essential character, the defining principles, the core identity of the original state? Be specific about what must be preserved for identity to continue.

### Step 2: Map the Changes

What specifically has changed? Document the developments without judgment initially.

### Step 3: Apply Each Note

Evaluate the development against each of the seven notes. Some notes may be more relevant than others for the specific case.

### Step 4: Weigh the Evidence

Newman noted that no single note is conclusive; they work together. Look for the overall pattern. Is the preponderance of evidence toward authentic development or corruption?

### Step 5: Render Judgment

Based on the cumulative evidence, is this change authentic development that should be embraced, corruption that should be reversed, or something ambiguous requiring further discernment?

## Constraints

- **Do not demand perfection.** Few developments will satisfy all seven notes fully. Look for the pattern.
- **Recognize legitimate variation.** Development need not follow only one path; different authentic developments are possible from the same origin.
- **Avoid presentism.** Judge the development by whether it preserves essential character, not by whether it matches current preferences.
- **Distinguish difficulty from corruption.** Something may be difficult to understand or accept while still being authentic development.
- **Be honest about ambiguity.** Some cases are genuinely unclear; acknowledge this rather than forcing a verdict.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "Our engineering team used to be small, scrappy, and move fast. Now we're 5x larger with processes, documentation requirements, and review gates. Have we lost our identity?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Development of Doctrine Analysis

### The Original State
A small engineering team characterized by speed, autonomy, and direct communication. Core principles: bias for action, individual ownership, minimal process overhead. Essential character: empowered engineers making quick decisions to ship value.

### The Current State
A larger team with defined processes, documentation requirements, and review gates. More people, more coordination overhead, more formal structures.

### Analysis by Note

| Note | Assessment | Evidence |
|------|------------|----------|
| 1. Preservation of Type | Preserved | Still an engineering team focused on shipping; engineers still empowered within defined bounds |
| 2. Continuity of Principles | Maintained | Bias for action now expressed through clear ownership and defined approval paths; ownership remains, scope changed |
| 3. Power of Assimilation | Assimilating | New processes serve engineering goals rather than becoming ends in themselves; reviews catch issues faster than earlier fire-drills |
| 4. Logical Sequence | Follows | Growth naturally requires coordination; processes emerged from pain points, not external mandate |
| 5. Anticipation of Future | Latent | Early "move fast" culture included implicit quality expectations; documentation formalizes what was previously tribal knowledge |
| 6. Conservative Action | Preserves | Fast shipping still valued; processes reduce rework rather than add arbitrary gates |
| 7. Chronic Vigour | Vigorous | Team continues to ship, attract talent, and tackle harder problems than before |

### Overall Assessment
**Authentic Development**

### Reasoning
The seven notes converge toward authentic development. The essential character (empowered engineers shipping value) is preserved, even as its expression has evolved. Processes emerged organically to solve real problems rather than being imposed externally. The team's vitality has increased, not decreased.

### Recommendations
1. Explicitly articulate the principles that must be preserved even as processes evolve
2. Regularly audit whether processes serve engineering or have become ends in themselves
3. Maintain deliberate spaces for the "small team" experience (hack weeks, small tiger teams)
4. Celebrate the continuity: "We still ship; we ship better"

## Integration

This skill is part of the **John Henry Newman** expert persona. It applies Newman's framework from *An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine* to organizational and technical contexts.

For related analysis:
- Use **illative-sense-reasoning** when the evidence for development vs. corruption is ambiguous and requires judgment
- Use **liberal-education-framework** when the development question concerns educational or formational approaches
